    <h1> HTML 이란 무엇인가</h1>
    Hypertext Markup Language <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/"
    target="_blank" title="html5 specification"> (HTML)<a>  is the standard Markup language for
    <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages </strong> and web application.

    <h2>Java Script</h2>

    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
      interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also
      characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
      multi-paradigm.</p>

    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies
      of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and
      thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
      websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
      engine to execute it.</p>
